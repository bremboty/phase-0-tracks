# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 version control allows someone to see all the changes that have been made to a source code and see when those changes were made, who made them, and why.  This allows for easier debugging.  Also, it helps to have your code in the cloud when your computer catches on fire.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
a branch is another version of the source code that you can mess up and destroy without affecting the real (master branch) source code.  this is helpful for projects so that you never make a mistake that can't be undone.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
a commit is a savepoint.  a good commit message is in present tense, is short, specific and descriptive.
* What is a merge conflict?
merge conflict happens when code doesn't match and the computer doesn't know what is correct and asks this to be resolved manually.
